## Features: 

* INDIVIDUALIZED SCHEDULES: Have an algorithm create an individualized, chronologically ordered schedule for a competitor's day at Harvard with the time and locations of impounds, self-scheduled events, standard competition events, and tournament wide events. These schedules are built using only three inputs: division, team name, and events. 
* APPLE MAPS INTEGRATION: 1) Tapping any event or impound in the custom schedule will open a pin with its location in Apple Maps. 2) The first panel of the app shows the building locations of all of one competitor's events. The room number of the first event in each building is highlighted.
* COMPETITOR PARTICIPATION: Photo submissions for pre-Awards Ceremony slideshows and individualized event and tournament wide feedback forms are encouraged from competitors and incentivized through various reward systems. 
* COMPETITOR SAFETY: Harvard police contact information is prominently displayed and accessible in the More panel. 
* FLOOR PLANS: Never get lost at Harvard again. Use floor maps designed by HUSO to navigate through the Science Center, Harvard Hall, and more. 
* CONTACT: Easily reach out to HUSO with from within the app using emails that are automatically half-written for the user. 
* ARBITRATION: Competitors can review arbitration protocols and forms and help get their coach involved.  
* WEBSITE: Peruse HUSO's website and files without ever leaving the app. 
* RESULTS: Be the first to find out how you and your team compared with the competition. 
* NEW VECTOR ART: <img src="/Images/logo.jpg" alt="HUSO Logo" width="30"/> Showcases newly designed logo to act as the icon for the app.


## Tournament Support

I would happily support any Science Olympiad tournament that would like to support this app. The app has been designed so that it is easy to implement for different tournaments and would require almost no effort on behalf of the tournament director of a Science Olympiad tournament.
